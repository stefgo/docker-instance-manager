/**
 * What an authenticated agent may send, and who handles it.
 *
 * The same two branches used to stand in both connection handlers -- once for the agent
 * that dials the server and once for the agent the server dials -- although the messages
 * are identical in both directions. A third message type would have had to be added twice,
 * and a forgotten copy shows up only at runtime, on whichever direction was missed.
 *
 * The handshake is deliberately not in here. `AUTH` is not a message an authenticated
 * agent sends, and each connection kind ties its own side effects to it: clearing a
 * timeout, persisting a new client, resetting a reconnect ladder. A table entry cannot
 * carry those, so the handshake stays with the connection that owns it.
 *
 * Payloads arrive unvalidated. Each handler in ProxyService parses its own with Zod --
 * they are the ones that know the shape they need.
