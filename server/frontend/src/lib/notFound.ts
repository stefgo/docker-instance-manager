 * Thrown while rendering by a route whose subject does not exist -- only once the list it
 * would be in has answered. The route tree's `errorElement` turns it into the not-found
 * card, and the URL stays where it was.
 *
 * Thrown in render rather than in a `loader`: the lists live in the query cache and are
 * kept current by the socket, so a client deleted while its page is open is noticed too.
 *
 * Only for a subject that is gone for good once it is missing. The router keeps the error
 * element until the next navigation, and a container or an image leaves the fleet state
 * for the moment a recreate takes -- their pages say "not found" themselves and show the
 * subject again when it is back.
